			A VU meter is used to display the loudness of an audio signal. This open source VU meter lights up ten LEDs to show how loud a mono audio signal is. Two of these can be made to show the loudness of each channel in a stereo signal. This circuit is similar to "Mono VU Meter Breadboard" except it is built on a PCB and requires soldering skills to assemble.
